**Description:	The Aim of this project is to detect users with signs of mental illnesses (depression in our	
case) given limited unstructured text data extracted from the Twitter social media platform. Mental
illness detection in social media can be considered a complex task, mainly due to the complicated nature
of mental disorders. In this Case, Natural Language Processing is used to process the Unstructured data, and then CNN model is trained to predict whether the user is depressed or not, using his/her tweets.**
